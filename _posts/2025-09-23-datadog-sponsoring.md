## Datadog sponsoring

Since September 2025, [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is sponsoring Vox Pupuli.
Datadog offers a [CI analytics platform as a service](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/ci-cd-monitoring/).
It enables us to forward information from all our GitHub Actions to Datadog and visualize them.
We will only forward public information, for example the duration of each job and the used runner.
This will enable us to identify repositories with flaky tests, long running jobs that should be split up or moved to bigger runners, or jobs on a runner operating system that will be deprecated soon.

As soon as we have the dashboards ready, they will be public.
Configuring them requires a bit of work.
If you're interested in working with Datadog, or already have some knowledge that you want to share, please come to our [#voxpupuli](https://voxpupuli.org/connect/) channel.
