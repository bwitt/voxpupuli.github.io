## Config Management Camp 2026

This is the conference where most of us meet once a year.
The conference itself is free.
But please sign up, and select the talks you would like to see, to make the room planning easier.
The conference is where most of us meet each other every year.
It's the best place to discuss the future of [OpenVoxProject](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2025/06/14/an-unsupportable-path/) and Vox Pupuli.

Ghent is easy to reach by train, the station is [Gent-Sint-Pieters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rsatG69CJ5Sy6Lyp7).
The next airport is Brussels Airport, which has a direct train connection to Ghent (different options available, intercity is the fastest).

In the past we made had good experiences with the [Novotel Gent Centrum](https://all.accor.com/hotel/0840/index.nl.shtml) and the [ibis Gent Centrum](https://all.accor.com/hotel/0961/index.nl.shtml) hotels.
Anything around the [de Abt restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1jkEUZgHmr45MBXR9) is usually fine.
Most of the attendees stay in this location and there's also a tram line to the conference.

[cfgmgmtcamp.org/ghent2025/guide/](https://cfgmgmtcamp.org/ghent2025/guide/) also has a good overview for people that are new to the conference.

The call for papers is also still open!
You want to do an ignite or a regular talk about OpenVoxProject, Vox Pupuli, a cool project you worked on or a migration story from Perforce to OpenVoxProject?
[Please submit](https://cfp.cfgmgmtcamp.org/ghent2026/cfp) the proposal until 2025-10-15 23:59 CET.

## Vox Pupuli Travel fund for Config Management Camp 2026

Since three years ago, Vox Pupuli is part of the open source collective and can receive donations.
So far we received over 25,000USD and have 18,000USD in our bank account.

We would like to use a part of that to enable people to attend [Config Management Camp](https://cfgmgmtcamp.org/ghent2026/) in Ghent.

## Sponsoring

We recognize not everyone is able to make it to an in person conference but we want to enable as many people as possible to attend the conference.
If we can help you attend, please send a short motivation letter, by the end of 2025-10-31 (UTC), with a rough cost estimation.
We ask you to list the different costs (e.g. flight: X USD, Hotel Y USD) and if you're fine with just parts of it getting sponsored.
Please send it to [pmc@voxpupuli.org](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org).
The PMC will then decide which applicants receive how much funding.
If you've an employer, please ask them if they are interested in co-sponsoring your trip.
Our funding budget is 8,000 USD.
We'll try our best to get as many people to the conference but will take previous contributions into account.
We can only reimburse valid invoices, we cannot book anything on your behalf!
