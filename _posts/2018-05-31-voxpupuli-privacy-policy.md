I'm sure everyone is tired of the innundation of Privacy Policy update emails that you've been getting over the last several weeks. I'm happy to say that Vox Pupuli won't be adding to that pile of unread emails, but we _do_ have a new Privacy Policy.

## Why?

Vox Pupuli has never had a Privacy Policy before, so why are we adding one now?

Well, because of the new European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that began enforcement on May 25th, 2018. With the new rules put in place by the GDPR relating to storing private data, we felt that it was important to layout what data the Vox Pupuli stores/has access to in our projects and what we do with that data.

## What data is stored?

In short, we don't actively store any data about our "Customers" or those that simply just fork or use our projects and code. However, we _do_ have the name and email address of Contributors that add commits and open Pull Requests within Vox Pupuli projects stored within the git commit history of the project. We also have access to any public data that is stored in your Github account. All that said, there is no other data that Vox Pupuli, as a community, stores about their users and contributors.

## What is that data used for?

Let's set this straight now, Vox Pupuli does **NOT** in _any way_ sell or otherwise give your data out to any company, organization, or other institution. That said, due to the Open Source nature of the project, anyone with a copy of our code will have a copy of the name and email of the contributors that have committed changes to the source code. That data is **only used for historical purposes**.

## Where can I find the Privacy Policy in full?

You should read the [Privacy Policy](https://voxpupuli.org/privacy-policy/) in full for more details on what your rights are as a contributor to the overall Vox Pupuli project.

In the coming days, we will be adding links to the Privacy Policy in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file found in all of our projects.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reachout over [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?#voxpupuli?#voxpupuli) or via [E-Mail](pmc@voxpupuli.org)
