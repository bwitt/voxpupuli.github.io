Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹

If youâ€™d like to join in, you can still submit your logo proposals for the poll until 2025-10-31.

Check it out here: [OpenVoxProject/planning#71](https://github.com/OpenVoxProject/planning/issues/71)

After that, weâ€™ll open a new poll and (finally!) pick a logo ðŸ˜„

Cheers,
@rwaffen on behalf of the PMC
